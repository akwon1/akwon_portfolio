## About Me
**Angie Kwon (MCP/MPH '28)** \
I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2024 with a B.A. double majoring in Psychology and Art. Currently, I am in the process of obtaining a dual degree in City Planning and Public Health at the University of Pennsylvania. I am taking this course to create a strong foundation for public policy oriented quantitative data analysis, which is I lack experience in. I hope to work in public policy in the future, and this would strengthen my diverse skillset.
